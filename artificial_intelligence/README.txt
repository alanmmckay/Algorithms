This folder contains three subfolders which hold algorithms explored in the
undergrad artificial intelligence course at the university. The course 
emphasized on the influence of finding a solution for any problem as a 
motivation for artificial intelligence. Naturally, the first assignment was
an application of the Breadth First Search algorithm, applied to a number maze
in this case.

From there, we extended this concept by introducing adversarial search by
implementing a minimax search tree. The adversarial game being played here is
a reduced version of mancala in which there is one row of pits and overflow
pieces aren't recycled to existing pits.

The third assignment explored genetic algorithms; using the various genetic
approaches to mutate and select a binary string given some fitness heuristic.
